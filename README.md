# nanpos2

> 2nd version of nanpos with vue 2.x and Buefy - Bulma ;) among other sueful libraries (I'll make the list when the development wuill be over for the first version)

The long awaited 2nd version of NAN POS is getting close! 

This is a complete rewrite of NAN POS using VueJS 2 as the base progressive framework and using mostly components and Vuex. Hope you'll enjoy the re-write. 
Please, understand this is an ongoing project and it's not yet finished. I hope to finish it by may, where I'll also publish the backend.

PS: Sorry guys for being so long but big changes happened in my life and it has been a tough and long year.
